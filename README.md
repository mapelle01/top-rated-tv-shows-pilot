# 📺 Top Rated TV Shows – Pilot Data Project

This repository contains a **pilot data analysis and prediction project**
developed as a first hands-on exercise to practice data analysis workflows
using Python.

The project focuses on learning and experimentation rather than producing
a fully optimized solution.

## 🎯 Goals
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Introductory predictive modeling
- Hands-on practice with Python data tools

## ⚠️ Note
This project is part of an early learning phase and will be refined as
technical skills improve over time.
